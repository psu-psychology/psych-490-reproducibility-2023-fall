## Dates {-}

Due: [Friday, September 8]{.orange_due}.

## Goals {-}

This exercise gives you an opportunity to consider how the norms (and counter-norms) that appear common in scientific research compare with other human activities.

## Assignment {-}

Choose a realm of human activity that you are familiar with and preferable engage in yourself that is *not* scientific research--e.g., a sport or game, religious activity, club or social activity, political activity, or something else.
Choose two norms or counter-norms in your chosen activity and in a short essay (2-3 double-spaced pages in length) describe the norms or counter-norms in your chosen activity and discuss how they compare with the norms and counter-norms common in scientific research.

You may work with one other person if you so choose.

## Submit {-}

A 2-3 page paper in Microsoft Word format using the following file-naming convention:

`<lastname>-<firstname>-PSYCH490.009-ex02.docx`, where you substitute your last name for <lastname> and your first name for <firstname>.
If there are two authors, use both of your last names.
If Dr. Gilmore was submitting a paper, it would look like this: `gilmore-rick-PSYCH490.009-ex02.docx`.
Jie will create a dropbox on Canvas for submissions.
When that is ready, we will let you know via email.

Please use the APA format for your paper.
I found the following template document that would be a very good start:
