At the same time, the University is strongly committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.\nI will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community. The University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination, taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence.

In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice integrity in regard to all academic assignments.

The University is a community that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable. Irresponsible behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse and the use of violence against people or property, undermine the educational climate by threatening the physical and mental health of members of the community.

I will maintain a high standard of behavior by adhering to the Code of Conduct and respecting the rights of others.\nI will be responsible for my own academic progress and agree to comply with all University policies. The University allows students to identify and achieve their academic goals by providing the information needed to plan the chosen program of study and the necessary educational opportunities, but students assume final responsibility for course scheduling, program planning, and the successful completion of graduation requirements. I will be responsible for seeking the academic and career information needed to meet my educational goals by becoming knowledgeable about the relevant policies, procedures, and rules of the University and academic program, by consulting and meeting with my adviser, and by successfully completing all of the requirements for graduation."

Please keep your microphone muted unless you want to ask a question or interact with someone. If your microphone is not muted, the entire class will be able to hear what is going on in your environment. As an instructor, I personally like to see people’s faces. As a participant, I am more involved when I have my camera on. I realize, however, that there are many reasons why you might not want to turn on your camera such as poor internet connection, joining via phone, or other privacy concerns. It is your choice as to whether you would like to have the camera on or not."

Here’s an example: “In this essay, I describe an allegation of scientific misconduct by Dr. Dietrich Stapel that led to a paper retraction from the journal X. In doing so, I describe the consequences for Dr. Stapel’s career in science and responses the scientific community has made to make similar situations less likely in the future.”\nWrite two or more paragraphs in the body of your essay.

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn the ideal world, we want large samples so that we can be confident that when we find differences between groups A and B (Americans and Europeans; males and females; soccer players and badminton players, etc.) that the differences we find are not due to chance. In the real world, there are always trade-offs between the size of the samples we can collect and our ability to avoid making mistakes about what’s true and what’s not.\nOne way to think about those trade-offs is to think about our situation this way:\nSome “fact” about the world can either be true or false, and our data analysis should inform us about whether the fact is either true or false. We want to be right as often as possible. That means having a way of deciding something’s true when it actually is true and deciding when something’s false when it actually is false. Both are important ways for our analysis to be correct.\nWe also want to avoid being wrong. We don’t want to decide something’s true when it’s not. That’s a false positive. We also don’t want to decide something’s false when actually it’s true. That’s called a false negative. We want to minimize both.\nTo avoid false positives, we decide how often we are willing to be wrong in that way and set a criterion accordingly. The alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) value or criterion reflects that choice. It’s a probability, so it’s between 0 and 1. Since we want the fraction of the time we make false negative decisions to be small, \\(\\alpha\\) is also usually small; \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is conventional, but it is not in any way sacred.\nTo avoid false negatives, we set another probability value, called beta (\\(\\beta\\)). Beta is the proportion of times we’re willing to conclude a true fact is actually false; \\(\\beta = 0.20\\), or 1 time out of five is conventional. But what data folks usually focus on is \\(1-\\beta\\)1 or statistical power. This number tells us the proportion of times we expect to detect a true effect when it’s actually there. Detecting the truth is sort of a scientific superpower, don’t you think? At least when things go right. Maybe that’s why \\(1-\\beta\\) is called power.\nAnalysts who are planning a study have two other decisions to make: How big a sample should they collect, and how sensitive should their test be? The answer to how big a sample should always be large, but how large? The answer is, of course, called \\(n\\). How sensitive is the test can be asked this way: What’s the smallest difference I want to be able to detect–assuming I’m interested in the difference between condition A and condition B? That difference between conditions is called the effect size because it might represent the effect of some intervention. If we think effect sizes with respect to the standard normal (bell-curve-shaped) distribution with mean mu (\\(\\mu=0\\)) and standard deviation sigma (\\(\\sigma=1\\)), we can specify it in terms of the number of standard deviations. Specified this way, the effect size is usually called \\(d\\). There are other ways to talk about effect sizes, but we won’t go further here.\nYour goals in this assignment are to see how choices about sample size (\\(n\\)), effect size (\\(d\\)), alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and power (\\(1-\\beta\\)) relate to one another. You’ll explore the effects of different values for these parameters, report on the parameters you chose, and what the results turned out to be. There are no right or wrong answers."

    "text": "Your analysis\n\nWhen you first open the app, note that it simulates an analysis of groups A (red) and B, and that we get to control a number of parameters, including \\(n\\), \\(d\\), and \\(\\alpha\\). Note the statistics in the first gray box. It reports on the results of a \\(t\\) test, comparing the difference between the means of the two groups.\n\nInterpret the results of the t-test. What does it mean? What is the number in the brackets? What does it mean?\n“CI” means confidence interval. The CI has a minimum (leftmost) and maximum (rightmost) value. The actual difference in the observed means of A and B should fall inside the interval. In your own words, explain what the confidence interval means.\n\nLet’s see what happens when we generate different samples of A and B with the same underlying statistics–the same \\(n\\), same mean (\\(\\mu\\)), same standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), same effect size (\\(d\\)), and same criterion (\\(\\alpha\\)) or false positive rate.\n\nPress the Regenerate button. What happens to the histogram? Look in the grey t-test box. What happens to the t-test, and the mean values for A, B, the difference between A and B (B-A), and the CI?\nPress the Regenerate button a couple of times until Sig? changes from FALSE to TRUE or TRUE to FALSE? This is a form of p-hacking? Explain how. Remember the specific data we’re analyzing are being regenerated each time we press the button; what’s not changing is the sample size, standard deviation, and the effect size (difference between B and A).\n\nHaving \\(n=75\\) is a pretty large sample for many types of research in psychology, so let’s see what having smaller samples does to our t-test and to our power.\n\nBut before we do that, write down your prediction about what will happen to the t-test when we reduce the \\(n\\) for both groups A and B to 50.\nChange the \\(n\\) for A to 50 and the \\(n\\) for B to 50. Interpret the t-test and CI.\nWhat happened to power (see the box on the right side)? Does this mean we are more likely or less likely to detect a difference between A and B than before? Why?\n\nWe’re simulating what happens if there is an effect size of \\(d=0.5\\), or half a standard deviation between the means of A and B.\n\nChange \\(d\\) to 1.5 or larger. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power?\nChange \\(d\\) to 0.25. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power?\n\nLet’s see if we can find out what size of samples we’d need to have power \\(1-\\beta = 0.80\\) to detect an effect of (\\(d=0.25\\)). Increase the sample sizes of A and B until you exceed the desired level for power. What sample size did you need? Explain your finding.\n(Optional) Bonus Points (up to 5)\n\nExplore the effect of changing some other parameter on the results, for example, criterion/alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)), the standard deviation for A or B (\\(\\sigma\\)), or even the ‘baseline’ mean for B (\\(\\mu\\)).\nReport on what you changed, what you observed, and what you conclude."

The first is that the study is replicable in principle the sense that it can be carried out again, particularly when its methods, procedures and analysis are described in a sufficiently detailed and transparent way. The second is that the study is replicable in that sense that it can be carried out again and, when this happens, the replication study will successfully produce the same or sufficiently similar results as the original. A study may be replicable in the former sense but not in the second sense: one might be able to replicate the methods, procedures and analysis of a study, but fail to successfully replicate the results of the original study. Similarly, when people talk of a “replication”, they could also have in mind two different things: the replication of the methods, procedures and analysis of a study (irrespective of the results) or, alternatively, the replication of such methods, procedures and analysis as well as the results.”\n\n\n(Fidler & Wilcox, 2021)"

Part 93”. the proposed research will address the need for education and resource development for individuals assisting with the handling of research misconduct allegations at the inquiry or investigation phases. To date, there has been no published research on this topic as most Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training emphasizes the prevention of research misconduct rather than the policy and processes that govern the handling of research misconduct allegations. The study team will conduct a needs assessment through benchmarking with other institutions to identify and prioritize the creation of educational materials and trainings. The study team will then use the needs assessment to create online modules to provide foundational knowledge of research misconduct processes, definitions, and procedures for inquiry officials and investigation committee members. The study team will then implement the newly created resources and seek feedback from the appropriate stakeholders. In addition, the study team will explore to what extent, if any, standing committees develop a deeper understanding of the research misconduct process. This will help to inform which, if either, committee type is more efficacious. Research on standing versus ad hoc committees is also lacking in the literature. This proposed research has the potential to positively impact the research integrity community at large with much needed tools, resources, training and research on the management of research misconduct allegations.\nhttps://ori.hhs.gov/blog/ori-awards-three-research-integrity-grants"

(2011)\nFirst, notice that in our original report, we redacted the many measures other than father’s age that we collected (including the dependent variable from Study 1: feelings of oldness). A reviewer would hence have been unable to assess the flexibility involved in selecting father’s age as a control. Second, by reporting only results that included the covariate, we made it impossible for readers to discover its critical role in achieving a significant result. Seeing the full list of variables now disclosed, reviewers would have an easy time asking for robustness checks, such as “Are the results from Study 1 replicated in Study 2?” They are not: People felt older rather than younger after listening to “When I’m Sixty-Four,” though not significantly so, F(1, 17) = 2.07, p = .168. Finally, notice that we did not determine the study’s termination rule in advance; instead, we monitored statistical significance approximately every 10 observations. Moreover, our sample size did not reach the 20-observation threshold set by our requirements.\nThe redacted version of the study we reported in this article fully adheres to currently acceptable reporting standards and is, not coincidentally, deceptively persuasive. The requirement-compliant version reported in Table 3 would be—appropriately—all but impossible to publish.\n\n\n(Simmons et al., 2011)"

    "text": "Results\n\nWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P &lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.\n\n\n(Collaboration, 2015)"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\n\nNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.\nReproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.\n\n\n(Collaboration, 2015)"

    "section": "Degrees of freedom",
    "text": "Degrees of freedom\nOne way to think about what’s going on here is that we analysts want an efficient way to summarize complex sets of data. Statistics like the mean or median, standard deviation, and correlation often do that. If a big set of data is well described by one of these statistics, then we’ve saved ourselves a lot of time and headache. If we think about a summary of some dataset as having \\(m\\) degrees of freedom, what we mean is that we only need \\(m\\) numbers for the summary. So, if we summarize a big dataset with the mean, then our summary (or model) has only one degree of freedom. If we include the standard deviation, then our summary has two degrees of freedom. If we use a linear regression to predict y ~ x then we usually have a slope estimate and an intercept estimate, or two degrees of freedom.\nIf we’re summarizing a raw dataset with \\(n=142\\) points in X and \\(n=142\\) datapoints in Y like the datasauRus sets above, being able to summarize with just a few numbers (degrees of freedom) is powerful and efficient. And in general, we analysts favor more parsimonious models of data–those with fewer degrees of freedom.\nThe problem arises when our simple models with few degrees of freedom don’t really capture important information about datasets, or when they persuade us to think (wrongly) that datasets with the same summary statistics are necessarily comparable. They might be, but they might not be. We have to look at the data–plot it–and confirm that we haven’t lost information in simplifying a dataset with a small number of statistics. The datasauRus and anscombe plots show us perverse situations when the small degree of freedom summaries are deeply misleading.\nThe converse is also true. We can describe a dataset increasingly precisely with a large number of degrees of freedom. For example, imagine that our model of one of the datasauRus sets has \\(2*n\\) degrees of freedom, where \\(n=142\\). If those 284 numbers are equal to the data points themselves, our summary has captured the data exactly. But we haven’t really gained anything, have we? We’ve just redescribed the data without reducing it to a summary with fewer degrees of freedom than existed in the first place. So, the best summaries (models) of data are small (in the number of degrees of freedom), but not too small."

How many steps (degrees of freedom) did the analysts take to reach their conclusions? Ideally, as few as possible, and certainly far less than the number of data points.\nSo, how many researcher degrees of freedom are too many? That’s a judgment call. But whatever you determine, justify your argument. And maybe see whether the authors plotted their data in a way that helps make a case one way or the other."
