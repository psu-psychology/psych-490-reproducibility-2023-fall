## As a producer...

- Commit to openly sharing your
  - data, protocols, code
  - from the very beginning
- Carry through on your commitment
- Encourage, help others
- Strive to get better

## As a consumer...

- Keep your skepticism sharp
- Ask how do we know that? Why do they think that?
- Data + reasoning
- Support policies, outlets that encourage openness, transparency

>…So I have just one wish for you—the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. **May you have that freedom**.
