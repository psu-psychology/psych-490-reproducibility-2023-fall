>We analyze the natural process of flipping a coin which is caught in the hand. We show that vigorously flipped coins tend to come up the same way they started...For natural flips, the chance of coming up as started is about .51.

::: {.callout-note}

The *New York Times* published an article [@Dominus2017-th](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html) on the controversy surrounding Dr. Cuddy's work called "When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy."

I considered reading this and discussing it, but I was more interested in the substantive claims made in the papers and in the talk.

Reading the Times' story would make a great final project topic, however.

:::

## [Chapter 6 in @Ritchie2020-fm] 

- Problems with scientific press releases
    - Not written by scientists
    - give unwarranted advice
    - cross-species leaps or generalizations
    - equating correlation with causation

---

- "Churnalism"
    - Journalists do not do their own investigations but repeat press releases
- Popular books (by scientists, too) can gloss over complexities, nuances
- Positive rhetoric/spin
- Counter-example from OPERA study of faster-than-light particle

# Power-posing

---

Carney, D. R., Cuddy, A. J. C. & Yap, A. J. (2010). Power posing: Brief nonverbal displays affect neuroendocrine levels and risk tolerance. *Psychological Science*, 21(10), 1363–1368. <https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797610383437>

---

>Humans and other animals express power through open, expansive postures, and they express powerlessness through contractive postures. But can these postures actually cause power? 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Carney2010-gq]
</p>

---

>The results of this study confirmed our prediction posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine behavioral changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Carney2010-gq]
</p>

---

>In posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-actionable implications.

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Carney2010-gq]
</p>

## Methods

- $n=42$ participants (26 female; age or other demographic characteristics?)
- Assigned into two groups (high power vs. low power)
- Experimenter posed bodies
- Two different poses held for 1 min

- Other tasks/measures
    - Gambling task (risk-taking, powerful feelings)
    - Self-reported feelings of power
    - Saliva samples (pretest and ~ 17 min after pose)
        - Tested for cortisol, testosterone

## A replication attempt

Ranehill, E., Dreber, A., Johannesson, M., Leiberg, S., Sul, S. & Weber, R. A. (2015). Assessing the robustness of power posing: no effect on hormones and risk tolerance in a large sample of men and women [Review of Assessing the robustness of power posing: no effect on hormones and risk tolerance in a large sample of men and women]. *Psychological Science*, *26*(5), 653–656. journals.sagepub.com. <https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614553946>

>We conducted a conceptual replication study task in both the gain dom with a similar methodology as that employed by Carney et al. but using a substantially larger sample (N= 200) and a design in which the experimenter was blind to condition. 

<p style="text-align:center;"> 
[@Ranehill2015-dj]
</p>

---

>Our statistical power to detect an effect of the magnitude reported by Carney et al. was more than 95% (see the Supplemental Material available online). In addition to the three outcome measures that Carney et al. used, we  also studied two more behavioral tasks (risk taking in the loss domain and willingness to compete).

<p style="text-align:center;"> 
[@Ranehill2015-dj]
</p>

---

>Consistent with the findings of Carney et al., our results showed a significant effect of power posing on self-reported feelings of power. However, we found no significant effect of power posing on hormonal levels in any of the three behavioral tasks.

## Methods

- Sampled $n=100$ after power analysis; then sampled another 100.
- 3 min pose durations
- Participants modeled poses following computer instructions.
- No deception.

## Reproducibility notes

- Article was behind a paywall.
- The PDF was available via authenticated access to PSU Libraries.
- The PDF did not easily permit cutting and pasting of text, so it was hard to excerpt those for this document.
- The HTML version of the article was unavailable, so I had to make screenshots of figures.

---

- There is an [OSF site](https://osf.io/6akvt) with data and materials.
    - The OSF site includes very helpful details about the experiments.
    - The data and code were shared, but I don't have access to the statistical program used (Stata) to rerun the analysis. The data had a `.dta` file extension. This appears to be a plain text, 'tidy' data file format that could be used by another program.

## Exploring logical/causal diagrams

Causal diagrams are one tool to reveal an authors' claims and assumptions.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Behaviors] -->B(Feelings)
  A -->C((Physiology))
```

---

A folk psychology view might hold that feelings cause behaviors.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  B(Feelings) -->A[Behaviors]
  C((Physiology))
```

Here, the role of physiology in this process isn't clear.

---

Or that feelings and physiological responses (e.g., hormones like cortisol and testosterone) together influence behaviors.

```{mermaid}
%%| width: 80%
flowchart LR
  B(Feelings) -->A[Behaviors]
  C((Physiology)) -->A
```

---

Neuroscientists might argue that feelings are the *outcome* of physiological processes like hormone levels and nervous system activity.

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-height: 6.5
flowchart LR
  B(Feelings) -->A[Behaviors]
  C((Physiology)) -->A
  C -->B
```

---

And that physiological processes influence one another.

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-height: 6.5
flowchart LR
  B(Feelings) -->A[Behaviors]
  C((Physiology)) -->A
  C -->B
  C -->C
```

---

To understand the full system of influences, we might need to look at a more complicated causal model. Here, behaviors influence and are influenced by physiology. Behaviors influence, and are influenced by feelings through influences on physiology. 

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-height: 6.5
flowchart LR
  C((Physiology)) -->A[Behaviors]
  C -->C
  C -->B(Feelings)
  B -->C
  A -->C
```

---

However, the evidence presented in [@Carney2010-gq](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797610383437) and  [@Ranehill2015-dj](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797614553946) show that 'posing' behavior influences feelings, but not (hormonal) physiology. 

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-height: 6.5
flowchart LR
  A[Posing] -->|Increases|B(Feelings)
  A -->|No influence on|C((Physiology))
```

---

If the neuroscientific view is correct, there must be another route for behaviors to influence feeling through physiology. That route is probably nervous system activity.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  C((Nervous System)) -->A[Behaviors]
  A -->C
  C -->C
  C -->D
  D((Hormones)) -->A
  D -->C
  D -->D
  C -->B(Feelings)
  B -->C
  D -->B
```

::: {.callout-note}

It can be useful to sketch an author's implicit causal model if that model is not stated explicitly.

::: {.callout-note}

Gilmore thinks that this interconnected network of plausible causal pathways is another reason why the behavioral and biological sciences are so challenging.
