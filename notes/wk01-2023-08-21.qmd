## Who trusts science?

>The results showed that political conservatism, religiousness, conspiracy ideation, and openness to experience significantly contributed to trust in science, while education did not. Furthermore, after controlling for these factors, an aspect of intellectual humility, openness to revising one's viewpoint, emerged as one of the key predictors of trust in science.

## Why should we care who trusts science & why they do or don't?
